Graphweaver is a knowledge graph builder that transforms unstructured text into structured, queryable knowledge. 
It extracts entities and relationships from PDFs using NER, converts them into triples, and stores them as interconnected nodes and edges in Neo4j for semantic querying and intelligent retrieval.
